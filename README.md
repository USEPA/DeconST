# DeconST
This is the Decontamination Selection Tool.  There is a version for the chemical warfare agents VX and HD.  There is also a version for the biological agent Bacillus anthracis.
There is a training video that is too large to put on GitHub.  If you would like a copy please email me at lemieux.paul@epa.gov and I'll figure out how to get you a copy.
